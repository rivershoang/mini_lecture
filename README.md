# Some topics that I done to improve my RTL skill
 - I was inspired by [this person's](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/md-irshad-alam-953241270_rtl-codes-of-comb-and-seq-cell-activity-7263763571111567360-wtE-?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) 50-day RTL code challenge post on LinkedIn.
 - Please explore `doc` before `src` or `tb`.
 - The `sim` folder will contain `.vcd` files, which you can open to view waveforms using GTKWave or any other compatible tool.
 - Don't misunderstand, I still use SV for some verification tasks that only it can figure out the errors.
